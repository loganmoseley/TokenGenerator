# Welcome

Thanks for considering contributing to TokenGenerator. It’s a small project, so every bit counts.

This project is intended to be opinionated in usage and small in scope. That’s how it differs from the “build system” style infinitely template-able design token projects. Please just keep that in mind.

That said, improving documentation, bug triaging, writing tutorials, or even adding a new “export” are all very helpful!

# Getting Started
Unsure where to begin? You can start by adding an export for your language of choice, or by checking out any [Issues](https://github.com/loganmoseley/TokenGenerator/issues).

For people who have never contributed to open source before, here are a couple of friendly tutorials: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/.


# One More Thing

My preferred style for commit messages is to summarize in the imperative mood then, if necessary, a more extensive description in present tense. [Example from 951bbda9](https://github.com/loganmoseley/TokenGenerator/commit/951bbda9387ad027b12e1895be299c8b66cb9f86):

> Define swatch colors before semantic colors
>
> Semantics reference swatches, so swatches must come first in SCSS. Swift and XML follow suit for consistency.
